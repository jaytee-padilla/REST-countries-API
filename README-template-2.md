## Overview

### Skills

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS Preprocessor
- Bulma CSS Framework
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Typescript
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com)
- Axios HTTP Client
- Webpack

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Note
- IMPORTANT NOTE 1: The free tier of the IP Geolocation API is limited to 1000 credits (a.k.a requests). If the API is no longer loading content properly, it's more than likely because the free credits have run dry
- IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Make sure adblock is turned off when using the site. It will prevent the API from working
